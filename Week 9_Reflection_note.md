# Week 9 Reflection
This week, I learned how to create an HTML page and a PHP search page for a basic OPAC.
It felt pretty good because I didn't run into many issues, except for a small mistake when adding data to MySQL.
I forgot to put a semicolon at the end of the command â€“ an easy thing to miss. 
It made me realize how important it is to be super careful with the details in this kind of work.
