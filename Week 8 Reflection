# Week_8_Reflection

Week 8 brought a challenging moment as I grappled with the PHP installation.
While attempting to check Apache2 status using the command `Systemctl status apache2`, 
I hit a roadblock â€“ the system hadn't booted with systemd as the init system, and things spiraled downward. 
I encountered issues like unrecognized services, non-existent directories, and the ominous "host is down." 
It was days of frustration, feeling utterly lost. 
Uncertain if my Google Cloud setup was at fault or if I was wandering in the command line wilderness, 
I decided to rewind to Week 1's class. 
Surprisingly, my Google Cloud VM setup needed configuration adjustments. 
This experience highlighted the learning process involved in navigating the command-line environment for me.
I discovered that troubleshooting requires a methodical, step-by-step reassessment of your setup.
